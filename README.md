# hashedpassword

A small Go package for hashed password. Provides an alternate API around [`simple-scrypt`](https://github.com/elithrar/simple-scrypt).

### Usage

``` go
package main

import "github.com/jpillora/hashedpassword"

type User struct {
	Password hashedpassword.Pwd
}

func main() {
	u := User{}

	//attempt manual set
	u.Password = "1234"
	u.Password.Verify("1234") //false

	//generates rand salt then hashes
	u.Password.Set("helloworld")
	u.Password.Verify("worldhello") //false
	u.Password.Verify("helloworld") //true

	//string value
	u.Password //"16384$8$1$b553a4306779af101a75c3e0b085e0e9$4c05fcd11c56ba1560f1b6094e38383b15b9a7ab0126718f7d44a68ab3d53207"
}

```

*Note* This packages API is suited for use with Go structs. For standalone strings, see [`simple-scrypt`](https://github.com/elithrar/simple-scrypt) or [`bcrypt`](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt).
